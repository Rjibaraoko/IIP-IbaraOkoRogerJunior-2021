# School music player project in C#

As a exam project at college I had to make a musci player in C#.

Although this is not really a concrete cybersecurity project, it still shows my skills in C# that I had to develop to pass the cursus.
Nor is it the cleanest solution for such a project but I think it is a good proof of concept of what I'm capable of if we are talking about being able to make
scripts.
